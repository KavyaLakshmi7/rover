Project: Breast cancer classification using connectivity aware graph transformer

Abstract:

1.This project aims to classify the breast cancer subtypes from pathology images which are digitalized by attaining the pathology test patches from hospital resource and normalized using gan.
2.The major complication of spatial patterns of cells are overcome by the graph transformer which capture long range dependencies.
3.Connectivity aware graph transformers creates the topological connectivity of the tissue graph constructed from digital pathology images.
4.The spatial distance between arbitrary nodes are encoded as connectivity bias in self attention in order to harness the connectivity of the nodes. 
5.This CGT is evaluated on a large cohort of breast carcinoma digital pathology image stained by haematoxylin and eosin.
6.This would outstand the accuracy of state of art methods as the node is constructed for tissue and not for cell.
7.The encoding leads to local connectivity aggregation and connectivity bias in self attention with multi head attention leads to classification of breast cancer.
8.Initially the dataset used for this is BRACS region of interest dataset. Then the normalized gan applied images are tested.
